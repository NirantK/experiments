regulation policy or condition relate to sustainability include climate change work stoppage labor unrest or travel relate accident can disrupt travel globally or otherwise result in decline in travel demand because these event or concern and the full impact of -pron- effect be largely unpredictable -pron- can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for -pron- platform and service which would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition event such as sudden outbreak of war or regional instability have lead to large number of localized cancellation and safety concern which harm -pron- business and -pron- relationship with -pron- host and guest in addition increase awareness around the impact of air travel on climate change and the impact of over tourism may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industry and demand for -pron- platform and service -pron- financial performance be also subject to global economic condition and -pron- impact on level of discretionary consumer spending some of the factor that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic condition worldwide or regional recession unemployment consumer debt reduction in net worth fluctuation in exchange rate residential real estate and mortgage market taxation energy price interest rate consumer confidence tariff and other macroeconomic factor consumer preference tend to shift to low cost alternative during recessionary period and other period in which disposable income be adversely affect which could lead to decline in the booking and price for stay and experience on -pron- platform and an increase in cancellation and thus result in low revenue leisure travel in particular which account for substantial majority of -pron- current business be dependent on discretionary consumer spending level downturn in worldwide or regional economic condition such as the current downturn result from the covid-19 pandemic have lead to general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending and similar downturn in the future may materially adversely impact demand for -pron- platform and service such shift in consumer behavior would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition the business and industry in which -pron- participate be highly

experience such as viator getyourguide klook traveloka and kkday -pron- competitor be adopt aspect of -pron- business model which could affect -pron- ability to differentiate -pron- offering from competitor increase competition could result in reduce demand for -pron- platform from host and guest slow -pron- growth and materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition many of -pron- current and potential competitor enjoy substantial competitive advantage over -pron- such as great name and brand recognition long operate history large marketing budget and loyalty program as well as substantially great financial technical and other resource in addition -pron- current or potential competitor have access to large user basis and/or inventory for

and effectively than -pron- can to new or change opportunity technology standard or host and guest requirement or preference the global travel industry have experience significant consolidation and -pron- expect this trend may continue as company attempt to strengthen or hold -pron- market position in highly competitive industry consolidation amongst -pron- competitor will give -pron- increase scale and may enhance -pron- capacity ability and resource and lower -pron- cost structure in addition emerge start up may be able to innovate and focus on develop new product or service fast than -pron- can or may foresee consumer need for new offering or technology before -pron- there be now numerous compete company that offer home for booking which can be available on -pron- platform on compete platform and through direct book site some of these competitor also aggregate property listing obtain through various source include the website of property manager some of -pron- host have choose to cross list -pron- property which reduce the availability of such property on -pron- platform when property be cross list the price pay by guest on -pron- platform may be or may appear to be less competitive for number of reason include difference in fee structure and policy which may cause guest to book through other service which could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition certain property manager reach out to -pron- host and guest to incentivize -pron- to list or book directly with -pron- and bypass -pron- platform and certain host may encourage transaction outside of -pron- platform which reduce the use of -pron- platform and service some of -pron- competitor or potential competitor have more establish or varied relationship with consumer than -pron- do and -pron- could use these advantage in way that could affect -pron- competitive position include by enter the travel and accommodation business for example some competitor or potential competitor be create super apps where consumer can use many online service without leave that company ’s app e.g. in particular region such as asia where commerce transaction be conduct primarily through app on mobile device if any of these platform be successful in offer service similar to -pron- to consumer or if -pron- be unable to offer -pron- service to consumer

activity which could adversely impact -pron- brand and reputation and lower the adoption rate of -pron- platform for example there have be shooting fatality and other criminal or violent act on property book on -pron- platform include as result of unsanctioned house party there have be incident of sexual violence against host guest and third party and -pron- have see high incident rate of such conduct associate with private room and share space listing there have be undisclosed hide camera at property and there have be incident of host and guest engage in criminal fraudulent or unsafe behavior and other misconduct while use -pron- platform the method use by perpetrator of fraud and other misconduct be complex and constantly evolve and -pron- trust and security measure have be and may currently or in the future be insufficient to detect and help prevent all fraudulent activity and other misconduct for example there have be incident where host have misrepresent both the quality and location of -pron- property in some instance to send guest to different and inferior property there have be incident where guest have cause substantial property damage to listing or misrepresent the purpose of -pron- stay and use listing for unauthorized or inappropriate conduct include party sex work drug relate activity or to perpetrate criminal activity there have be instance where user with connected or duplicate account have circumvent or manipulate -pron- system in an effort to evade account restriction create false review or engage in fraud or other misconduct and situation have occur where host or guest mistakenly or unintentionally provide malicious third party access to -pron- account which have allow those third party to take advantage of -pron- host and guest in addition certain region where -pron- operate have high rate of violent crime or more relaxed safety standard which can lead to more safety and security incident and may adversely impact the adoption of -pron- platform in those region and elsewhere if criminal inappropriate fraudulent or other negative incident continue to occur due to the conduct of host or guest or third party -pron- ability to attract and retain host and guest would be harm and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected such incident have prompt and may in the future prompt strict home sharing regulation or regulatory inquiry into -pron- platform policy and business practice in the united states and other country -pron- have see listing be use for party in violation of airbnb ’s policy which have in some case result in neighborhood disruption or violence further claim have be assert against -pron- from -pron- host guest and third party for compensation due to fatality accident injury assault theft property damage privacy and security issue fraudulent listing and other incident that be cause by other host guest or third party while use -pron- platform these claim subject -pron- to potentially significant liability and increase -pron- operating cost and could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- have obtain some third party insurance which be subject to certain condition and exclusion for claim and loss incur base on incident relate to booking on -pron- platform even where -pron- do have third party insurance such insurance may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claim of liability investigation cost defense cost and/or payout even if these claim do not result in liability -pron- could incur significant time and cost investigate and defend against -pron- as -pron- expand -pron- offering and tier such as the addition of airbnb experiences or if the quantity or severity of incident increase -pron- insurance rate and -pron- financial exposure will grow which would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition measure that -pron- be take to improve the trust and safety of -pron- platform may cause -pron- to incur significant expenditure and may not be successful -pron- have take and continue to take measure to improve the trust and safety on -pron- platform combat fraudulent activity and other misconduct and improve community trust such as require identity and other information from host and guest attempt to confirm the location of listing remove suspect fraudulent listing or listing repeatedly report by guest to be significantly not as describe and remove host and guest who fail to comply with -pron- policy these measure be long term investment in -pron- business and the trust and safety of -pron- community however some of these measure increase friction on -pron- platform by increase the number of step require to list or book which reduce host and guest activity on -pron- platform and could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition implement the trust and safety initiative -pron- have announce which include among other thing limited verification of host and listing restriction on party house manual screening of high risk reservation restriction on certain type of booking and -pron- neighbor hotline or other initiative have cause and will continue to cause -pron- to incur significant ongoing expense and may result in few listing and booking or reduce host and guest retention which could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition as -pron- operate global platform the timing and implementation of these measure will vary across geography -pron- have invest and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of -pron- platform but there can be no assurance that these measure will be successful significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off -pron- platform or be sufficient to protect -pron- reputation in the event of such activity furthermore -pron- have establish community standard but those standard may not always be effectively enforce communicate to or consistently understand by all part of -pron- community for example while -pron- require and communicate to host and guest to make certain commitment with respect to diversity and belong when -pron- join airbnb these standard and requirement be not always well understand by all part of -pron- community as result host and guest may be surprised or disappoint when -pron- expectation be not meet in response to the covid-19 pandemic -pron- have institute number of policy and measure to address the use of -pron- platform during the covid-19 pandemic in particular -pron- have launch cleaning program and safety practice that be intend to help prevent transmission of covid-19 all host outside of china be ask to commit to these standard include uniform five step cleaning process host in china maintain separate cleaning program -pron- provide substantial additional resource and good practice to help host implement the cleaning process include an enhanced cleaning protocol checklist and other written and visual material each host be responsible for implement the cleaning process -pron- be unable to control or verify the implementation of this process by each host and follow these program may cause -pron- host to incur significant expenditure which may impact the attractiveness of -pron- platform and may impact host willingness to list on -pron- platform host who do not agree to follow these standard may also be suspend or remove from the platform and -pron- host may choose to list on other platform instead of participate in -pron- cleaning program if significant number of host be remove or decide to list on other platform as result of -pron- cleaning program -pron- business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affect host and guest must also agree to follow covid-19-related safety practice such as social distancing if -pron- host or guest do not follow the guideline -pron- may suffer financial or other repercussion which may make -pron- platform less appealing and may impact -pron- business further such policy may not be successful in prevent the transmission of covid-19 case of suspect covid-19 exposure or infection during airbnb reservation have be report to -pron- if guest or host believe that booking stay or experience on -pron- platform pose heighten risk for contracting covid-19 or other disease -pron- reputation and business could be materially adversely affect and -pron- could give rise to legal claim against -pron- -pron- rely on traffic to -pron- platform to grow revenue and if -pron- be unable to drive traffic cost effectively -pron- would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- believe that maintain and strengthen -pron- brand be an important aspect of -pron- effort to attract and retain host and guest in particular -pron- rely on market to drive guest traffic to -pron- platform -pron- have invest considerable resource into establish and maintain -pron- brand as result of the covid-19 pandemic -pron- realign -pron- organizational priority to far increase -pron- focus on individual host and brand marketing while reduce performance marketing -pron- brand marketing effort include variety of online and offline marketing distribution channel -pron- brand marketing effort be expensive and may not be cost effective or successful for example in november -pron- announce partnership with the international olympic committee for nine year to cover the next five olympic games the covid-19 pandemic have delay the olympics and the continue uncertainty around covid-19 and other geopolitical factor could undermine -pron- ability to realize the value of the partnership if -pron- competitor spend increasingly more on brand marketing effort -pron- may not be able to maintain and grow traffic to -pron- platform -pron- have use performance marketing product offer by search engine and social medium platform to distribute pay advertisement that drive traffic to -pron- platform for the year end december and the nine month end september approximately and approximately respectively of the traffic to -pron- platform come from pay performance marketing channel the remainder of -pron- traffic in those period come through direct or unpaid channel which include brand marketing and search engine optimization seo critical factor in attract host and guest to -pron- platform be how prominently listing be display in response to search query for key search term the success of home sharing and -pron- brand have lead to increase cost for relevant keyword as -pron- competitor competitively bid on -pron- keyword include -pron- brand name -pron- have suspend substantially all performance marketing effort as -pron- take mitigating action in relation to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic -pron- strategy be to increase brand marketing and use the strength of -pron- brand to attract more guest via direct or unpaid channel and to decrease -pron- performance marketing spend relative to however -pron- may not be successful at -pron- effort to drive traffic growth cost effectively if -pron- be not able to effectively increase -pron- traffic growth without increase in spend on performance marketing -pron- may need to increase -pron- performance marketing spend in the future include in response to increase spend on performance marketing from -pron- competitor and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected the technology that power much of -pron- performance marketing be increasingly subject to strict regulation and regulatory or legislative change could adversely impact the effectiveness of -pron- performance marketing effort and as result -pron- business for example -pron- rely on the placement and use of cookie text file store on host or guest ’s web browser or device to support tailor marketing to consumer many country have adopt or be in the process of adopting regulation govern the use of cookie and similar technology and individual may be require to opt in to the placement of cookie use for purpose of marketing for example -pron- be subject to evolve eu privacy law on cookie and marketing in the european union regulator be increasingly focus on compliance with requirement in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem and current national law that implement the eprivacy directive may be replace by an eu regulation know as the eprivacy regulation which will significantly increase fine for non compliance in the european union informed consent may be require for the placement of cookie on user ’s device and for direct electronic marketing the european general data protection regulation 2016/679 gdpr also impose condition on obtain valid consent while the text of the eprivacy regulation be still under development recent european court of justice decision and regulator recent guidance be drive increase attention to cookie and track technology under exist law if regulator start to enforce the strict approach this could lead to substantial cost require significant system change limit the effectiveness of -pron- marketing activity divert the attention of -pron- technology personnel adversely affect -pron- margin increase cost and subject -pron- to additional liability widespread adoption of regulation that significantly restrict -pron- ability to use performance marketing technology could adversely affect -pron- ability to market effectively to current and prospective host and guest and thus materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- focus on unpaid channel such as seo seo involve develop -pron- platform in way that enable search engine to rank -pron- platform prominently for search query for which -pron- platform ’s content may be relevant change to search engine algorithm or similar action be not within -pron- control and could adversely affect -pron- search engine ranking and traffic to -pron- platform -pron- believe that -pron- seo result have be adversely affect by the launch of google travel and google vacation rental ads which reduce the prominence of -pron- platform in organic search result for travel relate term and placement on google to the extent that -pron- brand and platform be list less prominently or fail to appear in search result for any reason -pron- would need to increase -pron- pay marketing spend which would increase -pron- overall customer acquisition cost and materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition if google or apple use -pron- own mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor -pron- own or other preferred travel service offering or impose policy that effectively disallow -pron- to continue -pron- full product offering in those channel there could be an adverse effect on -pron- ability to engage with host and guest who access -pron- platform via mobile app or search moreover as guest increase -pron- booking activity across multiple travel site or compare offering across site -pron- marketing efficiency and effectiveness be adversely impact which could cause -pron- to increase -pron- sale and marketing expenditure in the future which may not be offset by additional revenue and could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition in addition any negative publicity or public complaint include those that impede -pron- ability to maintain positive brand awareness through -pron- marketing and consumer communication effort could harm -pron- reputation and lead to few host and guest use -pron- platform and attempt to replace this traffic through other channel will require -pron- to increase -pron- sale and marketing expenditure -pron- debt obligation contain restriction that impact -pron- business and expose -pron- to risk that could materially adversely affect -pron- liquidity and financial condition if -pron- require additional funding to support -pron- business this additional funding may not be available on reasonable term or at all -pron- have outstanding long term indebtedness with principal amount of 1,997.5 million as of september the agreement govern -pron- indebtedness -pron- credit agreements contain various covenant that be operative so long as -pron- credit agreement remain outstanding the covenant among other thing limit -pron- and -pron- subsidiary ability to incur additional indebtedness create or incur additional lien engage in certain fundamental change include merger or consolidation sell or transfer asset pay dividend and distribution on -pron- and -pron- subsidiary capital stock make payment and prepayment of junior or unsecured indebtedness make acquisition investment loan or advance engage in certain transaction with affiliate and enter into negative pledge clause and clause restrict subsidiary distribution if -pron- experience decline in cash flow due to any of the factor describe in these risk factors or otherwise -pron- could have difficulty pay interest and the principal amount of -pron- outstanding indebtedness if -pron- be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the fund necessary to make required payment under -pron- credit agreements or if -pron- fail to comply with the various requirement of -pron- indebtedness -pron- could default under -pron- credit agreements any such default that be not cure or waive could result in an acceleration of indebtedness then outstanding under -pron- credit agreements requirement that -pron- and -pron- subsidiary that have guarantee -pron- indebtedness pay the obligation in full and would permit the lender to exercise remedy with respect to all of the collateral that be secure -pron- indebtedness include substantially all of -pron- and -pron- subsidiary guarantor asset -pron- can not be certain that -pron- future operating result will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenant in -pron- credit agreements or to remedy any default under -pron- credit agreements interest rate under -pron- credit agreement be base partly on libor the london interbank offer rate which be the basic rate of interest use in lending between bank on the london interbank market and be widely use as reference for set the interest rate on loan globally libor be currently expect to phase out by the end of -pron- be unclear if at that time libor will cease to exist or if new method of calculate libor will be establish such that -pron- continue to exist after the u.s. federal reserve have begin publish secured overnight funding rate which be currently intend to serve as an alternative reference rate to libor if the method for calculation of libor change if libor be no long available or if lender have increase cost due to change in libor -pron- may suffer from potential increase in interest rate on -pron- borrowing further -pron- may need to renegotiate -pron- credit agreements or any other borrowing that utilize libor as factor in determine the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that be establish since the covid-19 pandemic there have be increase volatility in the financial and security market which have generally make access to capital less certain and increase the cost of obtain new capital as -pron- manage through the slowdown in -pron- business due to the covid-19 pandemic -pron- can not be sure that additional financing will be available to -pron- on reasonable term or at all in addition the term of future debt agreement could include more restrictive covenant which could further restrict -pron- business operation if -pron- can not raise additional fund when -pron- need -pron- -pron- ability to continue to support -pron- business and to respond to business challenge would be significantly limit and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected -pron- substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect -pron- financial condition -pron- have significant indebtedness that could materially adversely affect -pron- business by increase -pron- vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry condition require -pron- to dedicate substantial portion of -pron- cash flow from operation to payment on -pron- indebtedness thereby reduce the availability of -pron- cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditure acquisition product development effort and other general corporate purpose limit -pron- flexibility in plan for or react to change in -pron- business and the industry in which -pron- operate and expose -pron- to the risk of increase interest rate as -pron- borrowing be and may in the future be at variable interest rate the occurrence of any one of these event could have material adverse effect on -pron- business result of operation and financial condition and ability to satisfy -pron- obligation under -pron- credit agreements if -pron- be unable to manage the risk present by -pron- business model internationally -pron- business result of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected -pron- be global platform with host in more than country and region and approximately 100,000 city and global guest community as of september -pron- have office in city and have approximately 2,390 employee locate internationally for the year end december and the nine month end september and of -pron- revenue respectively be generate from listing outside of the united states -pron- expect to continue to make investment to expand -pron- international operation manage global organization be difficult time consuming and expensive and require significant management attention and careful prioritization and any international expansion effort that -pron- may undertake may not be successful in addition conduct international operation subject -pron- to risk which include operational and compliance challenge cause by distance language and cultural difference the cost and resource require to localize -pron- platform and service which often require the translation of -pron- platform into foreign language and adaptation for local practice and regulatory requirement unexpected more restrictive differing and conflict law and regulation include those law govern internet activity short term and long term rental include those implement in response to the covid-19 pandemic tourism tenancy taxis licensing payment processing messaging marketing activity registration and/or verification of guest ownership of intellectual property content datum collection and privacy security datum localization datum transfer and government access to personal information and other activity important to -pron- business uncertainty regard the interpretation of national and local law and regulation uncertainty in the enforceability of legal right and uneven application of law and regulation to business in particular u.s. company competition with company that understand local market well than -pron- do or that have local presence and pre existing relationship with potential host and guest in those market differ level of social acceptance of home sharing -pron- brand and offering legal uncertainty regard -pron- liability for the listing the service and content provide by host guest and other third party uncertain resolution of litigation or regulatory inquiry variation in payment form for host and guest increase operational complexity around payment and inability to offer local payment form like cash or country specific digital form of payment lack of familiarity and the burden of comply with wide variety of u.s. and foreign law legal standard and regulatory requirement which be complex sometimes inconsistent and subject to unexpected change potentially adverse tax consequence include result from the complexity of foreign corporate income tax system value add tax vat regime tax withholding rule lodge taxis often know as transient or occupancy taxis hotel taxis and other indirect taxis tax collection or remittance obligation and restriction on the repatriation of earning difficulty in manage and staff international operation include due to difference in legal regulatory and collective bargaining process fluctuation in currency exchange rate and in particular decrease in the value of foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar regulation govern the control of local currency and impact the ability to collect and remit fund to host in those currency or to repatriate cash into the united states oversight by foreign government agency whose approach to privacy or human right may be inconsistent with that take in other country increase financial accounting and reporting burden and complexity and difficulty in implement and maintain adequate internal control in an international operating environment political social and economic instability abroad terrorist attack and security concern in general operate in country that be more prone to crime or have low safety standard operate in country that have high risk of corruption and reduce or varied protection for -pron- intellectual property right in some country increase operating expense decrease revenue negative publicity negative reaction from -pron- host and guest and other stakeholder or other adverse impact from any of the above factor or other risk relate to -pron- international operation could materially adversely affect -pron- brand reputation business result of operation and financial condition in addition to the factor list above -pron- have invest heavily to expand -pron- operation in china which be an intensely competitive market both on the consumer side and from talent perspective -pron- expect to continue to incur significant expense to operate -pron- business in china and -pron- may not achieve profitability in that market as -pron- expand -pron- operation in china the above factor sentiment of the workforce in china and china ’s policy towards foreign direct investment may particularly impact -pron- operation in china further as -pron- expand -pron- operation in china -pron- expect to continue to make modification to the way -pron- website mobile app offering and feature function in china as compare to other country in addition -pron- need to ensure that -pron- business practice in china be compliant with local law and regulation which may be interpret and enforce in way that be different from -pron- interpretation and/or create obligation on -pron- that be costly to meet or conflict with law in other jurisdiction as -pron- disclose to -pron- host and guest when -pron- create or book listing in china -pron- be subject to various requirement and request from government agency to share information on user who use or offer accommodation service through -pron- platform in china failure to comply with such request or other requirement as interpret by government agency may lead to impairment or disruption to -pron- business and operation include fail to obtain or lose the necessary license to operate in china the blocking of -pron- platform and service in china and/or enforcement action against -pron- host community corporate entity or officer -pron- failure to comply with such request or requirement or conversely -pron- compliance with such request or requirement could materially adversely affect -pron- brand reputation business result of operation and financial condition further give that -pron- headquarters be in the united states any significant or prolonged deterioration in u.s.-china bilateral relation or escalation of geo political risk in china could adversely affect -pron- business in china the chinese government have adopt regulation that govern the dissemination of content over the internet and china ’s first cybersecurity law csl take effect in june the csl and relate regulation and implementation measure be continue to develop and -pron- be uncertain what obligation will apply to -pron- in the future in particular the csl impose high requirement for the operational security of facility include datum localization requirement for operator deem to be part of the critical information infrastructure however the definition of critical information infrastructure be not precise and there be substantial uncertainty as to -pron- ultimate interpretation and whether -pron- apply to -pron- chinese regulator be also consider additional regulation restrict the transfer of personal datum and important datum outside of china and -pron- could become subject to datum localization requirement in the future as result of this regulation and/or newly publish industry specific rule and regulation if -pron- be consider as an operator of critical information infrastructure or if -pron- become subject to restriction under other measure or datum localization requirement under other chinese law and regulation -pron- would incur substantial cost to comply or have to change -pron- business practice in manner that materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition action by the u.s. government could also impair -pron- ability to effectively operate in china include through the use of executive orders or trade blacklist to ban or limit the use of service provide by chinese third party -pron- conduct -pron- business in china through variable interest entity vie and wholly foreign own entity -pron- do not own share in -pron- vie and instead rely on contractual arrangement with the equity holder of -pron- vie to operate -pron- business in china because foreign investment be restrict or prohibit under -pron- contractual arrangement -pron- must rely on the vie and the vie equity holder to perform -pron- obligation in order to exercise -pron- control over the vie the vie equity holder may have conflict of interest with -pron- or -pron- stockholder and -pron- may not act in -pron- good interest or may not perform -pron- obligation under these contract if -pron- vie or -pron- equity holder fail to perform -pron- respective obligation under the contractual arrangement -pron- may not be able to enforce -pron- right in addition if the chinese government deem that the contractual arrangement in relation to -pron- vie do not comply with chinese governmental restriction on foreign investment or if these regulation or -pron- interpretation change in the future -pron- could be subject to penalty be force to cease -pron- operation in china or be subject to restriction in the future and -pron- may incur additional compliance cost the contractual arrangement with -pron- vie may also be subject to scrutiny by the chinese tax authority and any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxis -pron- track certain operational metric which be subject to inherent challenge in measurement and real or perceive inaccuracy in such metric may harm -pron- reputation and materially adversely affect -pron- stock price business result of operation and financial condition -pron- track certain operational metric include metric such as nights and experiences book gross booking value gbv active listing active booker host and guest arrival which may differ from estimate or similar metric publish by third party due to difference in source methodology or the assumption on which -pron- rely -pron- internal system and tool be subject to number of limitation and -pron- methodology for track these metric may change over time which could result in unexpected change to -pron- metric include the metric -pron- publicly disclose if the internal system and tool -pron- use to track these metric undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical error the datum -pron- report may not be accurate while these number be base on what -pron- believe to be reasonable estimate of -pron- metric for the applicable period of measurement there be inherent challenge in measure how -pron- platform be use across large population globally -pron- nights and experiences booked and gbv metric be adjust for cancellation and alteration that happen in the reporting period however cancellation and alteration for booking make in the reporting period can occur beyond the current reporting period this result in report amount of nights and experiences booked and gbv in the quarter of the booking for which all of the booking may ultimately not result in check ins and subsequently reduce -pron- nights and experiences booked and gbv metric in subsequent quarter when -pron- experience cancellation cancellation and alteration to previously book trip increase dramatically after the covid-19 outbreak as guest be either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling while the number of night and experience cancel in january be of the gross night and experience book that month the number of night and experience cancel in march and april exceed the number of gross night and experience book during those month if -pron- experience high level of cancellation in the future -pron- performance and related business metric will be materially adversely affect the calculation of nights and experiences booked gbv and active listing require the ongoing collection of datum on new offering that be add to -pron- platform over time -pron- business be complex and the methodology use to calculate nights and experiences booked gbv and active listing may require future adjustment to accurately represent the full value of new offering the number of active booker on -pron- platform be base on activity during certain time period certain individual may have more than one guest account and therefore may be count more than once in -pron- count of active booker -pron- count the number of host on -pron- platform base on the number of host with an available listing as of certain date some individual may have more than one host account and therefore may be count more than once as host -pron- metric include -pron- report nights and experiences booked gbv and active listing may include fraudulent booking account and other activity that have not be flag by -pron- trust and safety team or identify by -pron- machine learn algorithm or not yet address by -pron- operational team which could mean these activity on -pron- site be not identify or address in timely manner or at all reduce the accuracy of -pron- metric further any such fraudulent activity along with associated refund and cancellation would reduce -pron- metric in particular nights and experiences booked gbv and active listing in the quarter in which -pron- be discover limitation or error with respect to how -pron- measure datum or with respect to the datum that -pron- measure may affect -pron- understanding of certain detail of -pron- business which could affect -pron- long term strategy if -pron- operational metric be not accurate representation of -pron- business or if investor do not perceive these metric to be accurate or if -pron- discover material inaccuracy with respect to these figure -pron- reputation may be significantly harm -pron- stock price could decline -pron- may be subject to stockholder litigation and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected -pron- effort to create new offering and initiative be costly and if -pron- be unable to successfully pursue such offering and initiative -pron- may fail to grow and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected -pron- need to continue to invest in the development of new offering and initiative that differentiate -pron- from -pron- competitor such as airbnb experiences develop and deliver these new offering and initiative increase -pron- expense and -pron- organizational complexity and -pron- may experience difficulty in develop and implement these new offering and initiative -pron- new offering and initiative have high degree of risk as -pron- may involve unproven business with which -pron- have limit or no prior development or operating experience there can be no assurance that consumer demand for such offering and initiative will exist or be sustain at the level that -pron- anticipate that -pron- will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offering and initiative or that any of these offering or initiative will gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expense or liability -pron- be also possible that offering develop by other will render -pron- offering and initiative noncompetitive or obsolete further these effort entail investment in -pron- system and infrastructure payment platform and increase legal and regulatory compliance expense could distract management from current operation and will divert capital and other resource from -pron- more established offering and geography even if -pron- be successful in develop new offering and initiative regulatory authority may subject -pron- or -pron- host and guest to new rule taxis or restriction or more aggressively enforce exist rule taxis or restriction that could increase -pron- expense or prevent -pron- from successfully commercialize these initiative if -pron- do not realize the expected benefit of -pron- investment -pron- may fail to grow and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if -pron- fail to comply with federal state and foreign law relate to privacy and datum protection -pron- may face potentially significant liability negative publicity an erosion of trust and increase regulation could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition privacy and datum protection law rule and regulation be complex and -pron- interpretation be rapidly evolve make implementation and enforcement and thus compliance requirement ambiguous uncertain and potentially inconsistent compliance with such law may require change to -pron- datum collection use transfer disclosure other processing and certain other related business practice and may thereby increase compliance cost or have other material adverse effect on -pron- business as part of host and guest registration and business process -pron- collect and use personal datum such as name date of birth email address phone number and identity verification information for example government issue identification or passport as well as credit card or other financial information that host and guest provide to -pron- the law of many state and country require business that maintain such personal datum to implement reasonable measure to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the way in which such information can be collect and use for example the gdpr which become effective on may have result and will continue to result in significantly great compliance burden and cost for company like our the gdpr regulate -pron- collection control processing sharing disclosure and other use of datum that can directly or indirectly identify live individual personal datum and impose stringent datum protection requirement with significant penalty and the risk of civil litigation for noncompliance failure to comply with the gdpr may result in fine of up to million euro or up to of the annual global revenue of the infringer whichever be great -pron- may also lead to civil litigation with the risk of damage or injunctive relief or regulatory order adversely impact on the way in which -pron- business can use personal datum many large geography which be important to -pron- success include australia brazil canada china and india have pass or be in the process of pass comparable or other robust datum privacy legislation or regulation which may lead to additional cost and increase -pron- overall risk exposure in addition from the beginning of when the transitional period follow brexit expire -pron- will be require to comply with the gdpr and also the uk equivalent with each regime have the ability to fine up to the great of million euros million british pounds or of global turnover the relationship between the united kingdom and the european union in relation to certain aspect of datum protection law remain unclear for example how datum transfer between eu member state and the united kingdom will be treat and the role of the united kingdom ’s information commissioner ’s office with respect to the european union follow the end of the transitional period these change will lead to additional cost and increase -pron- overall risk exposure additionally -pron- be subject to law rule and regulation regard cross border transfer of personal datum include law relate to transfer of personal datum outside the european economic area eea recent legal development in europe have create complexity and uncertainty regard transfer of personal datum from the eea to the united states and other jurisdiction for example on july the cjeu invalidate the eu us privacy shield framework privacy shield under which personal datum could be transfer from the eea to us entity that have self certify under the privacy shield scheme while the cjeu uphold the adequacy of the standard contractual clause standard form of contract approve by the european commission as an adequate personal datum transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield -pron- note that reliance on -pron- alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstance this have create uncertainty and increase the risk around -pron- international operation in addition to other mechanism particularly standard contractual clause -pron- previously rely on -pron- own privacy shield certification and in limited instance the privacy shield certification of third party for example vendor and partner for the purpose of transfer personal datum from the eea to the united states -pron- continue to rely on the standard contractual clause to transfer personal datum outside the eea include to the united states additionally in certain circumstance -pron- rely on derogation provide for by law these recent development may require -pron- to review and amend the legal mechanism by which -pron- make and or receive personal datum transfer to the united states and other jurisdiction as -pron- lead supervisory authority the irish data protection commission the luxembourg national commission for data

furthermore to improve the trust and safety on -pron- platform -pron- conduct certain verification procedure aim at -pron- host guest and listing in certain jurisdiction such verification procedure

scrutiny and experience an adverse impact on -pron- relationship with government or -pron- ability to offer -pron- service within certain jurisdiction any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect -pron- brand reputation business result of operation and financial condition -pron- business also increasingly rely on artificial intelligence and automate decision make to improve -pron- service and tailor -pron- interaction with -pron- customer however in recent year use of these method have come under increase regulatory scrutiny new law guidance and/or decision in this area may limit -pron- ability to use -pron- artificial intelligence model or require -pron- to make change to -pron- operation that may decrease -pron- operational efficiency result in an increase to operating

decline in use of -pron- platform which would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition there be risk of security breach both on and off -pron- system as -pron- increase the type of technology -pron- use to operate -pron- platform include mobile app and third party payment processing provider and as -pron- collaborate with third party that may need to process -pron- host or guest datum or have access to -pron- infrastructure the evolution of technology system introduce ever more complex security risk that be difficult to predict and defend against an increase number of company include those with significant online operation have recently disclose breach of -pron- security some of which involved sophisticated tactic and technique allegedly attributable to criminal enterprise or nation state actor while -pron- take significant measure to guard against the type of activity that can lead to data breach the technique use by bad actor to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and often be unknown until launch against target as such -pron- may be unable to anticipate these tactic and technique or to implement adequate preventative measure further with large geographically disparate employee base -pron- be not immune from the possibility of malicious insider compromise -pron- information system and infrastructure this risk have grow in light of the great adoption of remote work as response to the covid-19 pandemic -pron- also have distribute community support organization include third party provider that have access to personal information -pron- and other company in -pron- industry have deal with incident involve such insider exfiltrate the personal datum of customer steal corporate trade secret and key financial metric and illegally divert fund no series of measure can fully safeguard against sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat in addition bad

any failure to maintain performance reliability security and availability of -pron- offering service and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of -pron- host and guest may harm -pron- reputation and -pron- ability to retain existing host and guest and attract new host and guest the ability of fraudster to directly target -pron- host and guest with fraudulent communication or cause an account takeover expose -pron- to significant financial fraud risk include costly litigation which be difficult to fully mitigate generally -pron- practice be to encrypt certain sensitive datum when -pron- be in transit and at rest however -pron- do not know whether -pron- current practice will be deem sufficient under applicable law or whether new regulatory requirement may make -pron- current practice insufficient moreover the existence of encryption in and of -pron- be not completely perfect security solution if there be breach of -pron- computer system and -pron- know or suspect that certain personal datum have be exfiltrate access or use inappropriately -pron- may need to inform the host or guest whose datum be steal access or use and may be subject to significant fine and

interrupt -pron- operation result in financial loss damage -pron- computer or those of -pron- host and guest or otherwise cause damage to -pron- reputation and business further the ability to bypass -pron- information security control could degrade -pron- trust and safety program which could expose individual to risk of physical harm or violence -pron- rely on third party service provider include financial institution to process some of -pron- datum and that of -pron- host and guest include payment information and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breach or improper access to or disclosure of such information could have adverse consequence for -pron- similar to an incident directly on -pron- system -pron- have acquire and will continue to acquire company that be vulnerable to security breach and -pron- be responsible for any security breach of these newly acquire company while -pron- conduct due diligence of these company -pron- do not have access to the full operating history of the company and can not be certain there have not be security breach prior to -pron- acquisition -pron- expend and expect to continue to expend significant resource to protect against security relate incident and address problem cause by such incident even if -pron- be to expend more resource regulator and complainant may not deem -pron- effort sufficient and regardless of the expenditure the risk of security relate incident can not be fully mitigate -pron- have heighten risk of security breach due to some of -pron- operation be locate in certain

business operation and result in lengthy interruption or delay of -pron- platform and service -pron- system and operation be also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct from external source and malicious insider -pron- exist security measure may not be successful in prevent attack on -pron- system and any such attack could cause significant interruption in -pron- operation for instance from time to time -pron- have experience denial of service type attack on -pron- system that have make portion of -pron- platform slow or unavailable for period of time there be numerous other potential form of attack such as phishing account takeover malicious code injection ransomware and the attempt use of -pron- platform to launch denial of service attack against another party each of which could cause significant interruption in -pron- operation or involve -pron- in legal or regulatory proceeding reductions in the availability and response time of -pron- online platform could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such attack on -pron- system and measure -pron- may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue be likely to become more difficult to manage as -pron- expand the number of place where -pron- operate and the variety of service -pron- offer and as the tool and technique use in such attack become more advanced and available successful attack could result in negative publicity and damage to -pron- reputation and could prevent consumer from book or visit -pron- platform during the attack any of which could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition in the event of certain system failure -pron- may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolong -pron- have experience system failure from time to time in addition to place increase burden on -pron- engineering staff these outage create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be address by -pron- community support team any unscheduled interruption in -pron- service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue an increase in community support cost and harm -pron- reputation and could result in some consumer switch to -pron- competitor if -pron- experience frequent or persistent system failure -pron- brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harm and -pron- business result of operation and

not be completely effective in reduce the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime -pron- do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate -pron- for all loss that may occur -pron- use both internally develop system and third party system to operate -pron- platform include transaction and payment processing and financial and accounting system if the number of consumer use -pron- platform increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating as design -pron- may need to significantly upgrade expand or repair -pron- transaction and payment processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure -pron- may not be able to upgrade -pron- system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depend on the

these refund and coupon be generally treat as reduction to revenue and -pron- may make payout for property damage claim under -pron- host guarantee program which -pron- account for as consideration pay to customer and be also generally treat as reduction in revenue robust community support effort be costly and -pron- expect such cost to continue to rise in the future as -pron- grow -pron- business -pron- have historically see significant number of community support inquiry from host and guest -pron- effort to reduce the number of community support request may not be effective and

-pron- also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of -pron- asset principally cash balance hold on behalf of host and guest that be denominate in currency other than the functional

risky include early stage company with limited cash to support -pron- operation and company whose result be negatively impact by downturn in the travel industry such as the one currently occur the company in which -pron- invest include early stage company that may still be develop product and service with limited cash to support the development marketing and sale of -pron- product further -pron- ability to liquidate such investment be typically dependent on liquidity event such as public offering or acquisition as no public market currently exist for the security hold in the investee valuation of privately hold company be inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for the security of such company if -pron- determine that any of -pron- investment in such

anticipated income tax liability -pron- income tax obligation be base in part on -pron- corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangement include the manner in which -pron- operate -pron- business develop value manage protect and use -pron- intellectual property and determine the value of -pron- intercompany transaction the tax law applicable to -pron- business include those of the united states and other jurisdiction be subject to interpretation and certain jurisdiction be aggressively interpret -pron- law in new way in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from company such as airbnb the tax authority of the jurisdiction in which -pron- operate may challenge -pron- methodology for value develop technology or intercompany arrangement which could increase -pron- worldwide effective tax rate and materially adversely affect -pron- result of operation and financial condition -pron- be subject to regular review and audit by u.s. federal state local and foreign

additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of 1.35 billion plus penalty and interest which exceed -pron- current reserve record in -pron- consolidated financial statement by more than 1.0 billion formal notice of propose adjustment be expect from the irs by the end of -pron- disagree with the propose adjustment and intend to vigorously contest -pron- if -pron- be not able to resolve the propose adjustment at the irs examination level -pron- plan to pursue all available administrative and if necessary judicial remedy which may include enter into administrative settlement discussion with the irs independent office of appeals irs appeals in and if necessary petition the u.s. tax court tax court for redetermination if an acceptable outcome can not be reach with irs appeals and finally and if necessary appeal the tax court ’s decision to the appropriate appellate court if the irs prevail in the assessment of additional tax due base on -pron- position and such tax and relate interest and penalty if any exceed -pron- current reserve such outcome could have material adverse impact on -pron- financial position and result of operation and any assessment of additional tax could require significant cash payment and have material adverse impact on -pron- cash flow in the third quarter of -pron- approve restructuring plan to repatriate -pron- intellectual property to the united states to align with -pron- evolve operation in post covid-19 environment the multiple transaction that comprise the restructuring be expect to be complete in the fourth quarter of the restructuring plan involve numerous intercompany arrangement and tax jurisdiction and require the valuation of multiple intercompany transaction which could be challenge by respective tax authority include as result of reduce valuation cause by forecast adjustment due to the impact of covid-19 and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- be currently under multilateral control audit mlc where number of individual european state audits be combine the mlc audit be focus on vat characterization and compliance access to host datum and transfer pricing tax authority may disagree with certain position -pron- have take and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition the determination of -pron- worldwide provision for income taxis and other tax liability require significant judgment by management and there be many transaction where the ultimate tax determination be uncertain -pron- provision for income taxis be also determine by the manner in which -pron- operate -pron- business and any change to such operation or law applicable to such operation may affect -pron- effective tax rate change in account for intercompany transaction may also affect -pron- effective tax rate for example with the adoption of asu no effective january the income tax effect of an intercompany transfer be recognize in the period in which the transfer occur rather than amortize over time which may increase the impact of such transfer on -pron- effective tax rate in particular period although -pron- believe that -pron- provision for income taxis be reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amount record in -pron- financial statement and could materially affect -pron- financial result in the period or period for which such determination be make in addition -pron- future tax expense could be adversely affect by earning be low than anticipate in jurisdiction that have low statutory tax rate and high than anticipate in jurisdiction that have high statutory tax rate by change in the valuation of -pron- defer tax asset and liability or by change in tax law regulation or accounting principle for example -pron- have previously incur loss in the united states and certain international subsidiary that result in an effective tax rate that be significantly high than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future -pron- may also be subject to additional tax liability relate to indirect or other non income taxis as describe in -pron- risk factor title uncertainty in the application of taxis to -pron- host guest or platform could increase -pron- tax liability and may discourage host and guest from conduct business on -pron- platform -pron- tax position or tax return be subject to change and therefore -pron- can not accurately predict whether -pron- may incur material additional tax liability in the future which would materially adversely affect -pron- result of operation and financial condition in addition in connection with any planned or future acquisition -pron- may acquire business that have differ license and other arrangement that may be challenge by tax authority for not be at arm’s length or that be potentially less tax efficient than -pron- license and arrangement any subsequent integration or continue operation of such acquire business may result in an increase effective tax rate in certain jurisdiction or potential indirect tax cost which could result in -pron- incur additional tax liability or have to establish reserve in -pron- consolidated financial statement and materially adversely affect -pron- result of operation and financial condition change in tax law or tax ruling could materially affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition the tax regime -pron- be subject to or operate under include income and non income include indirect taxis be unsettled and may be subject to significant change change in tax law or tax ruling or change in interpretation of exist law could materially adversely affect -pron- result of operation and financial condition for example the ninth circuit court of appeals issue decision in altera corp. v. commissioner in june of regard the treatment of stock base compensation expense in cost sharing arrangement which have material effect on -pron- tax obligation and effective tax rate for the quarter in which the decision be issue in addition on december the legislation commonly refer to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act be enact which contain significant change to u.s. tax law include reduction in the corporate tax rate and transition to more territorial system of taxation the primary impact of this legislation on -pron- provision for income taxis be reduction of the future tax benefit of -pron- defer tax asset as result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate since -pron- have record full valuation allowance against -pron- u.s. defer tax asset these change do not have material impact on -pron- consolidated financial statement however the impact of the tax act will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation the issuance of which could materially affect -pron- tax obligation and effective tax rate in the period issue on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act be enact in response to the covid-19 pandemic the cares act contain certain tax provision include provision that retroactively and/or temporarily suspend or relax in certain respect the application of certain provision in the tax act such as the limitation on the deduction of net operating loss and interest in addition many country in europe as well as number of other country and state have recently propose or recommend change to exist tax law or have enact new law that could significantly increase -pron- tax obligation in many country and state where -pron- do business or require -pron- to change the manner in which -pron- operate -pron- business for example in italy law require short term rental platform that process payment to collect and remit host income tax and tourist tax amongst other obligation airbnb have challenge this law before the italian court but if -pron- be unsuccessful this will lead to further compliance and potentially significant prior and future tax obligation the organization for economic cooperation and development have be work on base erosion and profit shifting project and issue report in and an interim report in and be expect to continue to issue guideline and proposal that may change various aspect of the exist framework under which -pron- tax obligation be determine in many of the country in which -pron- do business similarly the european commission and several country have issue proposal that would change various aspect of the current tax framework under which -pron- be tax these proposal include change to the exist framework to calculate income tax as well as proposal to change or impose new type of non income include indirect taxis include taxis base on percentage of revenue for example france italy spain and the united kingdom among other have each propose or enact taxis applicable to digital service which include business activity on digital platform and would likely apply to -pron- business the european commission have conduct investigation in multiple country focus on whether local country tax ruling or tax law provide preferential tax treatment that violate european union state aid rule and conclude that certain country include ireland have provide illegal state aid in certain case these investigation may result in change to the tax treatment of -pron- foreign operation due to the large and increase scale of -pron- international business activity many of these type of change to the taxation of -pron- activity describe above and in -pron- risk factor title uncertainty in the application of taxis to -pron- host guest or platform could increase -pron- tax liability and may discourage host and guest from conduct business on -pron- platform could increase -pron- worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income include indirect taxis impose on -pron- business and materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition such change may also apply retroactively to -pron- historical operation and result in taxis great than the amount estimate and record in -pron- financial statement -pron- ability to use -pron- net operating loss carryforward and certain other tax attribute may be limit as of december -pron- have net operating loss carryforward for u.s. federal income tax purpose of 116.7 million available to offset future taxable income if not utilize the federal net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in as of december -pron- have net operating loss carryforward for state income tax purpose of 167.6 million which will expire if not utilize begin in while federal net operating loss carryforward generate on or after january be not subject to expiration the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforward be limit to of -pron- taxable income for taxable year begin on or after january in addition -pron- expect to generate significant stock compensation deduction as result of this offering start in                       which would substantially increase the size of -pron- net operating loss carryforward realization of these net operating loss carryforward depend on -pron- future taxable income and there be risk that -pron- exist carryforward could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future taxable income which could materially adversely affect -pron- result of operation and financial condition in addition under section and of the internal revenue code of as amend the code if corporation undergo an ownership change generally define as great than change by value in -pron- equity ownership by significant stockholder or group of stockholder over three year period the corporation ’s ability to use -pron- pre change net operating loss carryforward and other pre change tax attribute such as research tax credit to offset -pron- post change taxable income or tax liability may be limited similar rule may apply under state tax law -pron- may have undergo ownership change in the past and -pron- may experience ownership change in the future because of shift in -pron- stock ownership many of which be outside of -pron- control -pron- ability to use -pron- pre change net operating loss carryforward and other tax attribute to offset future u.s. federal taxable income may be subject to limitation which could result in increase future tax liability to -pron- -pron- business depend on attract and retain capable management and employee and the loss of any key personnel could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- success depend in large part on -pron- ability to attract and retain high quality management and employee brian chesky joe gebbia and nathan blecharczyk found -pron- company and have be instrumental in devise and implement -pron- strategy for growth and scale -pron- business -pron- founder and other member of -pron- senior management team as well as other employee may terminate -pron- employment with -pron- at any time which could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition as -pron- continue to grow -pron- can not guarantee that -pron- will be able to attract and retain the personnel -pron- need -pron- business require highly skilled technical engineering design product datum analytic marketing business development and community support personnel include executive level employee who be in high demand and be often subject to compete offer competition for qualified employee and executive level employee be intense in -pron- industry and particularly in san francisco where -pron- have -pron- headquarters and other jurisdiction where -pron- operate the loss of qualified employee or an inability to attract retain and motivate employee require for the plan expansion of -pron- business would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition and impair -pron- ability to grow to attract and retain key personnel -pron- use various measure include an equity incentive program as -pron- continue to mature the incentive to attract retain and motivate employee provide by -pron- program or by future arrangement may not be as effective as in the past -pron- have number of current employee include -pron- founder who hold equity in -pron- company or whose equity award be or will become substantially vest upon the completion of this offering as result -pron- may be difficult for -pron- to continue to retain and motivate these employee and the value of -pron- holding could affect -pron- decision about whether or not -pron- continue to work for -pron- -pron- ability to attract retain and motivate employee may be adversely affect by decline in -pron- stock price if -pron- issue significant equity to attract employee or to retain -pron- exist employee -pron- would incur substantial additional stock base compensation expense and the ownership of -pron- exist stockholder would be further dilute in response to the economic challenge and uncertainty result from the covid-19 pandemic and -pron- impact on -pron- business in may -pron- announce reduction in force of approximately 1,800 employee this have lead to increase attrition and could lead to reduce employee morale and productivity and problem retain exist and recruit future employee which could have material adverse impact on -pron- business result of operation and financial condition consumer use of device and platform other than desktop computer create challenge if -pron- be unable to operate effectively on these platform -pron- business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affect people regularly access the internet through mobile phone tablet handheld computer voice assist speaker television set top device smart television wearable and automobile in dash system these device enable new modality of interaction such as conversational user interface and new intermediary such as super apps like wechat where consumer can use many online service without leave particular app -pron- anticipate that the use of these mean of access will continue to grow and that usage through desktop computer will continue to decline especially in certain region of the world experience the high rate of internet adoption the functionality and user experience associate with these alternative device such as small screen size or lack of screen may make the use of -pron- platform through such device more difficult than through desktop computer lower the use of -pron- platform and make -pron- more difficult for -pron- host to upload content to -pron- platform in addition consumer purchasing pattern can differ on alternative device and -pron- be uncertain how the proliferation of mobile device will impact the use of -pron- platform and service mobile consumer may also be unwilling to download multiple app from multiple company provide similar service mean that such consumer may opt to use one of -pron- competitor service instead of -pron- as result brand recognition and the consumer experience with -pron- mobile app will likely become increasingly important to -pron- business in addition these new modality create opportunity for device or system company such as amazon apple and google to control the interaction with -pron- consumer and disintermediate exist platform such as our -pron- need to provide solution for consumer who be limited in the size of the app -pron- can support on -pron- mobile device and address latency issue in country with low bandwidth for both desktop and mobile device because -pron- platform contain data intensive medium these issue be exacerbate as new device operate system and platform continue to be release -pron- be difficult to predict the problem -pron- may encounter in adapt -pron- offering and feature to -pron- and -pron- may need to devote significant resource to the creation support and maintenance of -pron- offering and feature -pron- success will also depend on the interoperability of -pron- offering with range of third party technology system network operate system and standard include ios and android the availability of -pron- mobile app in app store and in super app environment and the creation maintenance and development of relationship with key participant in related industry some of which may also be -pron- competitor in addition if accessibility of various app be limit by executive order or other government action the full functionality of device may not be available to -pron- customer moreover third party platform service and offering be constantly evolve and -pron- may not be able to modify -pron- platform to assure -pron- compatibility with those of third party if -pron- lose such interoperability -pron- experience difficulty or increase cost in integrate -pron- offering into alternative device or system or manufacturer or operating system elect not to include -pron- offering make change that degrade the functionality of -pron- offering or give preferential treatment to competitive product the growth of -pron- community and -pron- business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affect this risk may be exacerbate by the frequency with which consumer change or upgrade -pron- device in the event consumer choose device that do not already include or support -pron- platform or do not install -pron- mobile app when -pron- change or upgrade -pron- device -pron- traffic and host and guest engagement may be harm if -pron- be unable to adapt to change in technology and the evolve demand of host and guest -pron- business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affect the industry in which -pron- compete be characterize by rapidly change technology evolve industry standard consolidation frequent new offer announcement introduction and enhancement and change consumer demand and preference in -pron- begin make incremental investment in upgrade -pron- technology platform to service orient architecture improve data management and increase -pron- service reliability and -pron- invest heavily in -pron- technology in -pron- future success will depend on -pron- ability to adapt -pron- platform and service to evolve industry standard and local preference and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of -pron- platform and service in response to competitive offering and the evolve demand of host and guest -pron- future success will also depend on -pron- ability to adapt to emerge technology such as tokenization cryptocurrencie new authentication technology such as biometric distribute ledger and blockchain technology artificial intelligence virtual and augment reality and cloud technology as result -pron- intend to continue to spend significant resource maintain develop and enhance -pron- technology and platform however these effort may be more costly than expect and may not be successful for example -pron- may not make the appropriate investment in new technology which could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition further technological innovation often result in unintended consequence such as bug vulnerability and other system failure any such bug vulnerability or failure especially in connection with significant technical implementation or change could result in lose business harm to -pron- brand or reputation consumer complaint and other adverse consequence any of which could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition another critical component to -pron- future success will be -pron- ability to integrate new or emerge payment method into -pron- platform to offer alternative payment solution to consumer alternate payment provider such as alipay paytm and wechat pay operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both consumer and merchant in many region particularly in asia where credit card be not readily available and/or commerce be largely carry out through mobile device these and other emerge alternate payment method be the exclusive or preferred mean of payment for many consumer -pron- be subject to payment relate fraud and an increase in or failure to deal effectively with fraud fraudulent activity fictitious transaction or illegal transaction would materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- process significant volume and dollar value of transaction on daily basis when host do not fulfill -pron- obligation to guest there be fictitious listing on -pron- platform or there be host account takeover -pron- have incur and will continue to incur loss from claim by host and guest and these loss may be substantial such instance have and can lead to the reversal of payment receive by -pron- for such booking refer to as chargeback for the year end december and the nine month end september total chargeback expense be 92.2 million and 95.1 million respectively -pron- ability to detect and combat fraudulent scheme which have become increasingly common and sophisticated could be adversely impact by the adoption of new payment method the emergence and innovation of new technology platform include mobile and other device and -pron- growth in certain region include in region with history of elevated fraudulent activity -pron- expect that technically knowledgeable criminal will continue to attempt to circumvent -pron- anti fraud system in addition the payment card network have rule around acceptable chargeback ratio if -pron- be unable to effectively combat fictitious listing and fraudulent booking on -pron- platform combat the use of fraudulent credit card or otherwise maintain or lower -pron- current level of charge back -pron- may be subject to fine and high transaction fee or be unable to continue to accept card payment because payment card network have revoke -pron- access to -pron- network any of which would materially adversely impact -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- payment platform be susceptible to potentially illegal or improper use include money laundering transaction in violation of economic and trade sanction terrorist financing fraudulent listing host account takeover or the facilitation of other illegal activity use of -pron- payment platform for illegal or improper use have subject -pron- and may subject -pron- in the future to claim lawsuit and government and regulatory investigation inquiry or request which could result in liability and reputational harm for -pron- -pron- have take measure to detect and reduce fraud and illegal activity but these measure need to be continually improved and may add friction to -pron- booking process these measure may also not be effective against fraud and illegal activity particularly new and continually evolve form of circumvention if these measure do not succeed in reduce fraud -pron- business result of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected -pron- payment platform be subject to extensive government regulation and oversight -pron- failure to comply with extensive complex overlapping and frequently change law rule regulation policy legal interpretation and regulatory guidance could materially adversely affect -pron- business result of operation and financial condition -pron- payment platform be subject to

class common stock these policy be relatively new and -pron- be unclear what effect if any -pron- will have on the valuation of publicly trade company exclude from such index but -pron- be possible that -pron- may depress valuation as compare to similar company that be include because of the multi class structure of -pron- common stock -pron- will likely be exclude from certain index and -pron- can not assure that other stock index will not take similar action give the sustained flow of investment fund into passive strategy that seek to track certain index exclusion from certain stock index

emerge as result country impose strict lockdown in particular in europe similar to the impact of the initial covid-19 wave in march -pron- be see decrease in booking in the most affected region as

september gross night and experience book have be stable down approximately relative to the same period in the prior year cancellation and alteration of previously book trip increase dramatically

emea during this period which have historically high daily rate than latin america and asia pacific the gross daily rate be also impact by mix shift toward entire home listing in non urban destination which have high daily rate gross booking value before cancellation and alteration follow similar trend to gross night and experience book materially decline on year over year basis between march and

than the decline in nights and experiences book due to the growth in gross daily rate gbv reflect booking make in period for future night or experience and be lead indicator for revenue which be recognize during the period that stay and experience occur -pron- expect continued volatility in these trend and fluctuation from month to month as the continue impact from covid-19 be not linear across geography as some country and city have recently enact new lockdown and prohibition on travel and as covid-19 be continue to materially adversely affect -pron- business and financial result multiple resilient category be less impact and show strong recovery -pron- believe that the recovery in the second and third quarter of be attributable to the renew ability and willingness for guest to travel the resilience of -pron- host and relative strength of -pron- business model from december through september active listing remain stable at approximately 5.6 million despite the decline in book activity on -pron- platform due to covid-19 against an otherwise highly negative travel backdrop there be several area of -pron- business that have show resilience notably domestic travel short distance travel travel outside of -pron- top city and long term stay while -pron- believe that travel will change as result of covid-19 the adaptability of -pron- business suggest that -pron- be well position to serve this dynamic market as -pron- continue to evolve and recover to provide additional information on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on -pron- business -pron- have include below year over year comparison of monthly book trend in the fourth quarter of and the first nine month of domestic travel represent travel within the same country when the guest ’s origin country be the same as the destination country -pron- business historically have be weight toward cross border travel which account for of night in relative to -pron- estimate for the travel industry that of total overnight pay trip come from cross border travel while air and cross border international travel have be significantly impact by covid-19 domestic travel around the world have be extremely resilient in september global domestic night and experience book be of -pron- gross night and experience book compare to in january and domestic night and experience grow year over year take into account the high daily rate during this period domestic gross booking value before cancellation and alteration grow year over year in september short distance travel within mile of guest origin have be highly resilient even at the peak of the business interruption in april short distance stay be one of the fast grow category prior to the covid-19 pandemic this growth be further bolster by the covid-19 pandemic as many guest choose short distance trip instead of long distance travel from may through september this category grow year over year -pron- have also see stay between mile and mile from guest origin recover and return to year over year growth since june take into account the higher gross daily rate during this period gross booking value before cancellation and alteration for travel distance under mile grow year over year in september travel outside of -pron- top city base on gbv have be more resilient than those book in -pron- top city while gross night and experience book in -pron- top city by gbv be down in september compare to september those book outside of -pron- top city base on gbv be down only take into account the higher gross daily rate during this period gross booking value before cancellation and alteration for travel book outside of -pron- top city be flat year over year in september during period of travel restriction community lockdown and social distancing small destination have see relative strength as guest seek more remote destination outside crowd urban center -pron- believe this demonstrate the strength of -pron- global network and the diversification of -pron- business long term stay be stay on -pron- platform of at least night long term stay be one of -pron- fast grow category in as guest increasingly choose airbnb listing to meet -pron- need for stay of great length -pron- believe the long term stay category represent different use case than leisure travel and as result be not as impact as dramatically by covid-19 while the category of one to night short term stay be down year over year in april long term stay be down only year over year and see year over year growth from may through september take into account the high gross daily rate during this period gross booking value before cancellation and alteration for long term stay be up year over year in september recent development note table total may not properly sum from component due to round overall the historical mix of gross night and experience book by travel distance corridor and top city be similar to the historical mix of revenue by those category because long term stay have low gbv per night and low service fee the revenue by trip length be weight more toward short term stay covid-19 cost reduction position -pron- business for improved financial performance in response to the spread of covid-19 and the result material decrease in gbv -pron- undertake an internal review of -pron- cost structure ultimately make change to improve the strength of -pron- business in the long term specifically -pron- significantly reduce -pron- fix and variable cost which -pron- believe will result in improve operating leverage as -pron- emerge from covid-19 -pron- rapidly make change to manage -pron- expense in period of material business interruption which include the following among other suspend substantially all discretionary marketing program spend reduce full time employee headcount by approximately set expectation for the potential of no employee bonus for and reduce executive team member salary for six month significantly reduce all discretionary spend suspend all facility build out and significantly reduce capital expenditure and significantly reduce -pron- contingent workforce these headcount reduction and other restructuring action be expect to result in charge for range between million and million in conjunction with these action -pron- have realign -pron- organizational priority to far increase -pron- focus on individual host and brand marketing while pause -pron- investment in new area such as transportation and content and reduce performance marketing -pron- have do this to sharpen -pron- focus on investment that directly strengthen -pron- community and to increase the efficiency of -pron- operation as the travel industry begin to recover from the covid-19 pandemic -pron- believe these change should allow -pron- to more effectively manage -pron- business and improve -pron- financial operating result key factor affect -pron- performance ability to attract and retain hosts two of -pron- founder brian and joe be -pron- first host and host be the foundation of -pron- community -pron- be focused on continue to grow and retain the number of host who choose to list -pron- space and

active listing in as compare to from december through september active listing remain stable at approximately 5.6 million despite the decline in book activity on -pron- platform due to the global covid-19 pandemic -pron- believe this stability in active listing highlight the high retention of -pron- host community and the resilience of -pron- business model which do not require -pron- to make significant investment in fix asset and physical real estate in particular -pron- platform unlock the potential for individual host to share -pron- unique space and earn income in way that be

do not track contra revenue adjustment by host cohort -pron- believe such revenue generate from stay be the well available indicator of host retention the size of each host cohort have also grow every year and -pron- cohort be nearly four time large than -pron- cohort while active listing remain stable between december and september host revenue retention will deteriorate across all host cohort in due to the decline in revenue result from covid-19 however as the travel industry recover -pron- believe the historic strength of -pron- host revenue retention should return ability to attract and

unlikely idea to work airbnb have always be little different and as -pron- take -pron- company public -pron- feel compel to tell -pron- little more about what make airbnb airbnb -pron- start write this letter in march then the pandemic hit when border close and travel stop -pron- business decline by nearly -pron- have to put -pron- ipo on hold and do not think many people expect -pron- to go public this year know some people question if -pron- ’d make -pron- at all what have transpire since then have be -pron- most defining period since -pron- start airbnb -pron- say that crisis have way of reveal -pron- true character -pron- would like to tell -pron- about what this crisis reveal about who -pron- be first -pron- model be inherently adaptable over the summer after month of be stick inside -pron- home people be yearn to connect with -pron- love one in safe way -pron- decide to get in -pron- car and travel close to home often stay in small town and rural community because -pron- have million of host who offer nearly all type of home and experience around the world -pron- be able to adapt to the new use case guest want from work remotely from another home to take extended trip with family and friend -pron- business rebound fast than anyone expect and -pron- show that as the world change -pron- model be able to adapt this crisis reinforce three truth that be even more core to who -pron- be and how -pron- intend to operate for generation to come as -pron- prospective investor -pron- want to tell -pron- about each connection and belonging when -pron- start airbnb -pron- be about more than just travel in joe and be roommate in san francisco and -pron- be try to figure out how to pay -pron- rent that weekend design conference be come to san francisco and hotel be sell out so -pron- inflate three airbed and turn -pron- apartment into an airbed breakfast -pron- host three guest michael kat and amol and in do so -pron- become the first host on airbnb -pron- guest arrive as stranger but -pron- leave as -pron- friend the connection -pron- make that weekend lead joe and to realize maybe there ’ big idea here soon after nate join and -pron- create way for people around the world to be host just like -pron- since then -pron- have grow from two host in san francisco to community of over four million host all over the world on the surface what people come to airbnb for be new way to travel but below the surface what -pron- find on airbnb be connection -pron- experience deep connection to the community -pron- visit and the people who live there this connection be deliver by -pron- host and -pron- provide guest with deeply personal experience after all guest be welcome in -pron- home and -pron- live in -pron- community when the pandemic hit -pron- know -pron- could not pursue everything that -pron- use to -pron- choose to focus on what be most unique about airbnb -pron- core business of hosting -pron- get back to -pron- root and back to what be truly special about airbnb the everyday people who host -pron- home and offer experience -pron- scale back investment that do not directly support the core of -pron- host community this focus come at the right time people be feel increasingly disconnected in the world and loneliness be pervade -pron- society the opposite of loneliness be belong the feeling of deep and genuine connection to person place or community -pron- ’ the feeling of be at home the feeling of be know and love -pron- be community base on connection and belonging and -pron- will continue to design new way to provide for -pron- -pron- believe that -pron- have only scratch the surface -pron- will focus on connection and belonging -pron- will prioritize the individual host who deliver -pron- -pron- will invest in build -pron- community as the world continue to change people ’s fundamental need for connection and belonging will not this be what -pron- will remain focused on creatively lead airbnb be bear with creative spirit much like the environment at the rhode island school of design where joe and go to college together -pron- bring this creative spirit to airbnb and -pron- ’ one of the most defining part of -pron- culture -pron- use -pron- curiosity and imagination to come up with unconventional solution in fact start airbnb be in -pron- creative act the big idea be often leaps of the imagination while -pron- be dreamer -pron- be also pragmatic at the center of be creatively lead be -pron- design drive approach at airbnb design be not just how something look -pron- ’ how -pron- fundamentally work -pron- sit at the intersection of art and science commitment that start when nate an engineer join joe and -pron- -pron- use this approach to design system of trust that allow stranger to live together and unique business model that allow host to share in -pron- success and -pron- ’ this approach that will continue to enable -pron- to create new product and service that deliver connection even beyond travel -pron- be say that constraint breed creativity and during the crisis -pron- creatively lead approach be draw on time and again to come up with unconventional solution here be just couple of example with the onset of social distancing -pron- have to pause -pron- in person airbnb experiences but in matter of two week -pron- team pivot the product to become online experiences create new type of interactive experience that connect people from all over the world most recently as -pron- prepare to take airbnb public -pron- want to find new way for -pron- host to continue share in -pron- success rather than design moment in time perk that would have limited impact -pron- create the airbnb host endowment an entity that -pron- be seed with over nine million share of airbnb company stock in order to provide support for host for as long as airbnb exist these be just two example of the dozen of creative solution that this crisis bring about -pron- believe -pron- creativity will allow -pron- to continue design new possibility for people -pron- will use curiosity and imagination to create unconventional solution -pron- will take unique design drive approach -pron- will ensure creative people always have seat at the table be creatively lead be core to who -pron- be and how -pron- will run airbnb responsibility to -pron- stakeholder airbnb have always exist as delicate balance between -pron- five stakeholder -pron- guest -pron- host the community that -pron- operate in -pron- employee and -pron- shareholder in -pron- set out to institutionalize -pron- responsibility by define series of principle to serve each of -pron- stakeholder these principle be put to the ultimate test during the crisis when travel stop and border close -pron- guest need to cancel -pron- reservation many of which be non refundable in the face of the pandemic -pron- issue more than billion in refund guide by -pron- extenuate circumstance policy while this help -pron- guest -pron- create problem for -pron- host half of whom depend on -pron- airbnb income to pay -pron- rent or mortgage for -pron- host -pron- commit to pay up to million to those impact by cancellation to protect -pron- shareholder investment -pron- significantly reduce -pron- expense and raise billion in debt when face with the difficult decision to let many of -pron- employee go -pron- focus on treat every employee with respect and compassion provide generous severance package and extensive job search support and for the community that -pron- operate in -pron- partner with thousand of host who generously offer -pron- home to nurse doctor and many other work on the front line of the pandemic there be an emerge focus in the business world on serve stakeholder but there ’ false notion that to give to one -pron- have to take from another while in the short run there may be trade off in the long run and when approach with creativity -pron- believe that -pron- can design win win for all of -pron- stakeholder -pron- will design for the long term benefit of all stakeholder -pron- will measure -pron- progress for serve each of -pron- -pron- will adjust when -pron- do not get -pron- right -pron- responsibility to -pron- stakeholder will continue to guide how -pron- operate these be the idea at the core of airbnb -pron- community be base on connection and belonging -pron- creativity allow -pron- to imagine new possibility for people -pron- responsibility be to all of -pron- stakeholder in the end -pron- all share common thread fundamental belief that people be good and -pron- be in this together this be what make airbnb airbnb thank -pron- crisis bring -pron- clarity about what be truly important -pron- become thankful for not only what -pron- have in -pron- life but for who -pron- have in -pron- life -pron- be thankful for everyone who stick by -pron- during -pron- dark hour thank -pron- to -pron- employee -pron- have work tirelessly day and night for -pron- community and shareholder often at great personal sacrifice thank -pron- to -pron- investor -pron- invest in the seemingly impossible premise that stranger could live together and -pron- have stick with -pron- through thick and thin thank -pron- to -pron- host and guest without -pron- -pron- would not even exist -pron- have prove to the world that people can in fact trust one another and finally would like to personally thank -pron- joe and nate for be the good partner that could ever ask for in the depth of this crisis some people ask be this the end of airbnb -pron- be not the
